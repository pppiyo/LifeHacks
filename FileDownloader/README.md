# About
A small program that helps batch download files on the internet by simply feeding the url of the parent page to the command line.

# Motivation
Finding all slides listed on a webpage waiting to be downloaded, I figured creating a little tool would to helpful save much time and energy.<br>

# How to run
1. Download FileDownloader.py to your local machine.
1. Open terminal under the folder where FileDownloader.py is.
2. Type the following command in terminal and hit enter: "python3 FileDownloader.py".
3. Follow the directions of the program (basically just provide the url that leads to the list of files, and download will immediately start).

# Note
1. This program currently only supports downloading pdf and ppt files (others may be added later).
2. For bug-free experiences, preferably your files are supposed to be in situations like this:

  That is to say, 1) you have a parent link which leads you to see a page like this; 2) each file has its own link provided.<br><br>
3. Outcome will be like the following. You should be able to find the files in the folder where FileDownloader.py is.<br>
